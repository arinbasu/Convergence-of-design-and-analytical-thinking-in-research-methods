We will now expand the above concepts and add examples to show how this is effected. This is an important concept in health and health care, and for our cause and effect based thinking. Specifically, we have several checkpoints. In health, for instance, we discuss cause and effect in terms of:

1. Are we sure that the association that we observe is for real?
2. If we are sure that the association is for real, is that association causal or is that association non-causal?

How do we know that the association is a real association? In order to do that, we need to take care of three related entities:

1. We must make sure that the association is not one of mere chance
2. We must eliminate all forms of biases
3. We must control for confounding variables 

Then, once we have established that this association is one of real association, we can apply the considerations that Austin Bradford Hill applied. These are as follows:

1. Strength of Association. -- Strength here refers a composite of two entities: a measure of numerical association (in the form of relative risk or odds ratio), and a measure of prevalence of the exposure. If the strength of association is very high, and how high is very high is subjective, then we know that another factor, if that has to be an alternative cause, has to have even a higher strength to upstage the one we are considering.
2. Consistency of observation. -- Now that we have observed that the association is not trivial, how consistently have we observed this. Have more than one researcher studied this and found similarity? Differnt
