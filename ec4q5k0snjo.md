## Observe the facts
There are three related issues in research thinking that includes inductive and deductive thinking and how we conduct modern science. 

1. Observe the facts as objectively as possible. By "objectively", we mean that the observation of the facts should not be combined with the observer's internal emotional content, or the observer must not be influenced by the environmental variables, nor the observer let the conditions of the observation to influence his thoughts. Nothing should be omitted
2. Develop a theory that should explain the facts. This theory building should not be before observing the facts that will give rise to the theory. 
3. It must be more than one theory: at least two, and as many as possible. There should not be a theoretical upper limit to how many theories we can develop to explain the event or the observation in step 1.When the theories will be set up, we must make sure that the theory should be able to explain every fact. 
4. From each theory, develop hypotheses. Each of the hypotheses that you will develop will consist of very specific observaable entities. Each hypothesis must be measurable. Each hypothesis will also predict. 
5. Based on the hypothesis, now start collecting new data and repeat the observations. If the facts do not match with the hypothesis, reject that hypothesis.
6. Proceeding in this fashion, the last hypothesis that will stand will be accepted.
